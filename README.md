# The impact of gender on the relationship between body image and body schema

## Background:
Both body image and body schema, when corrupted, have pronounced psychological and physical effects. Body image refers to conscious perceptions of our body and the way we believe we look (Cash et al, 2002). It is, in essence, our self-image and the opinions we hold regarding the way we believe other people view us. By contrast, Body schema is considered to lay within the unconscious sphere of our understanding, with Haggard and Wolpert (2005) defining it as “a central representation of the positions of body parts in space, which is updated during body movement” and includes the arrangements of limbs, the configuration of these in space as well as the shape of the body. Much of the pre-existing literature alludes to a relationship or form of interplay between body image (BI) and body schema (BS). However, the exact nature of this relationship lacks a conclusive definiton or inclusive research. In fact, much of the existing literature fails to include male participants, leaving the unexplored question of how gender may impact on the BI-BS relationship.  

## Data Origins:
The data for this project is from my undergraduate dissertation project which aimed to answer the question "does gender moderate the relationship between body image and body schema?". For this project I will be looking at more general trends between the data. 

## Research Question:
The research question for this project is "are their gender differences in the relationship between body image and body schema?". This question was chosen as my dissertation project from last year showed that although gender did not moderate the relationship the trends between BI and Bs seemed to be different between genders. For this project I wanted to create a visualisation to look into this in more detail and add to the research previously conducted.
